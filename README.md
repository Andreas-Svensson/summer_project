exploratory AI project with course colleagues during summer break


## Data Collection

For simplicity's sake, we use <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org">Mozilla Common Voice</a> to gather our audio files. These files are used to train the model to recognize the voices that should not be used.

The target voice could be from <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/mhmw0h.mp3">a 5-minute Trump clip</a>.

In the Mozilla Common Voice link, navigate to "Datasets". ![Alt text](assets/mz-datasets.png)

Select a file, agree to the terms, enter your email, and proceed with the download. ![Alt text](assets/mz-download.png)

After the file is downloaded, rename it to something more manageable. ![Alt text](assets/mz-file.png)

Open the folder in the terminal and extract the file. ![Alt text](assets/mz-powershell.png)

You should now have a folder containing text files and MP3 files. ![Alt text](assets/mz-done.png)
